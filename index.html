    Before we begin, I’d like to briefly share my journey into programming.From a young age, I was fascinated by how coding was portrayed in movies. The fast typing, the problem-solving, the power of creating something from nothing it all drew me in. At first, it was just admiration, but as I began learning more about it, I realized how powerful and exciting programming really is.
My interest grew when I learned about the earning potential of developers and designers. That inspired me to explore the tech space even more seriously.
During school, we were encouraged to join clubs for extra-curricular activities. I consistently chose the computer club so often that the staff started recognizing me for it. While we mainly learned graphic design (which I appreciated), my real passion was coding. I wanted to build things. I wanted to type like the people I saw in films focused, fast, and intentional.
Every term, we repeated the same graphic design lessons. But one day, our instructor announced we’d be doing something new—hands-on coding. I was thrilled. We started with basic HTML. It wasn’t much, but I felt proud of what I did.
In the following session, we were introduced to Python. I was excited again, but I wasn’t able to properly understand its basics at the time. Even so, it opened my eyes to how powerful coding could be.
From there, I began learning JavaScript on my own. At first, I wasn’t consistent. But now? I’m taking it seriously—with full focus, commitment, and passion.
This portfolio is the result of that journey. And it’s just the beginning.
