        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>From a young age, I was fascinated by how coding was portrayed in movies. The fast typing, the problem solving, the power of creating something from nothing it all drew me in. At first, it was just admiration, but as I began learning more about it, I realized how powerful and exciting programming really is.
            My interest grew when I learned about the earning potential of developers and designers. That inspired me to explore the tech space even more seriously.
            During school, we were encouraged to join clubs for extra-curricular activities. I consistently chose the computer club so often that the staff started recognizing me for it. While we mainly learned graphic design (which I appreciated), my real passion was coding. I wanted to build things. I wanted to type like the people I saw in films focused, fast, and intentional.
            Every term, we repeated the same graphic design lessons. But one day, our instructor announced we’d be doing something new hands on coding. I was thrilled. We started with basic HTML. It wasn’t much, but I felt proud of what I did.
            In the following session, we were introduced to Python. I was excited again, but I wasn’t able to properly understand its basics at the time. Even so, it opened my eyes to how powerful coding could be.
            From there, I began learning JavaScript on my own. At first, I wasn’t consistent. But now? I’m taking it seriously with full focus, commitment, and passion.
            This portfolio is the result of that journey. And it’s just the beginning.
